## About Microfacet Models in Computer Graphic
  Computer graphics is one of the most important techniques in the 21st century. In modern films, especially some animation or special effects, the requirement of making the objects more realistic is going higher.
In this case, scientists has developed lots of approaches and models to solve this problem. Here we mainly discuss one of the most prevailing models: Microfacet Models. We will indtroduce how it works, and the physical meaning behind this model.




## Introduction

Modelling the real world is obviously not easy. People who want to make there graphic more realistic need to have a good knowledge about the physics behind them. This section briefly introduces the physics of modelling, BRDF, and also the basic idea of Microfacet model.





## Microfacet Model

### Theorm

This part gives a physical analysis for microfacet model, 


### [Oryan Nayar Model](/orennayarmodel/)

Oryan Nayar Model gives a more realistic model than previous model methods, such as Lambertian Model.

### [Bump Mapping](/bumpmapping/)

Bump Mapping is an important technique for understanding the Microfacet Distribution. This part introduces why we should use bump in microfacet models, and how bump mapping works.
