## About Microfacet Models in Computer Graphic
  Computer graphics is one of the most important techniques in the 21st century. In modern films, especially some animation or special effects, the requirement of making the objects more realistic is going higher.
In this case, scientists has developed lots of approaches and models to solve this problem. Here we mainly discuss one of the most prevailing models: Microfacet Models. We will indtroduce how it works, and the physical meaning behind this model.




## Introduction

Modelling the real world is obviously not easy. People who want to make there graphic more realistic need to have a good knowledge about the physics behind them. This section briefly introduces the physics of modelling, BRDF, and also the basic idea of Microfacet model.





## Microfacet Model

### Theorm

This part gives a physical analysis for microfacet model, 


### Oryan Nyer Model


The boilerplate kit is better for more drastic hacking and changes, a project that's quite different to any other and needs a lot of custom work done. Additionally you'll only be able to use this method if you want to host it on GitHub Pages, as [themes can't be submitted](https://pages.github.com/themes/)... yet.

Using the theme will allow you to receive updates made and will be more programmatic. To make your own changes you'll need to overwrite the files with your own. For example: If I want to change the colours of my site I'll need to copy the [`_colors.scss`](https://github.com/daviddarnes/alembic/blob/master/_sass/_colors.scss) file and create my own in `_sass/colors.scss` with my own changes. This is the same for all files within the theme, which means your own project will be more lean than if you were to use the boilerplate.

### Bump Mapping

Bump Mapping is an important technique for understanding the Microfacet Distribution. This part introduces why we should use bump in microfacet models, and how bump mapping works.
