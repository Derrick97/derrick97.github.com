## About Microfacet Models in Computer Graphic
  Computer graphics is one of the most important techniques in the 21st century. In modern films, especially some animation or special effects, the requirement of making the objects more realistic is going higher.
In this case, scientists has developed lots of approaches and models to solve this problem. Here we mainly discuss one of the most prevailing models: Microfacet Models. We will indtroduce how it works, and the physical meaning behind this model.




## Introduction

Modelling the real world is obviously not easy. Computer Graphic technician who wants to make their graphic more realistic needs to havengood knowledge about the physical theorems behind it. This section briefly introduces the radiometry section of optical physics, BRDF, and also the basic idea of Microfacet model.

## Microfacet-based Models

### Theory

Microfacet Theory is a theory based on realistic surfaces. It is interested in the normal distribution function of a surface which measures the distribution probability of the normals of the micro surfaces. This part gives a physical analysis for microfacet model.

### Oryan Nayar Model

Oryan Nayar Model gives a more realistic model than previous model methods, such as Lambertian Model. It is especially effective when modelling rough surface, because it gives a relatively reasonable algorthim to take care of light diffusion of irregular surface.

### Bump Mapping

Bump Mapping is an important technique for understanding the Microfacet Distribution. This part introduces why we should use bump in microfacet models, and how bump mapping works.

### Cook-Torrance
Cook-Torrance Reflectance Model is one of the greatest model for calculating the reflection on rough surfaces. Compared to some old models, which is poor in tackling the micro features of a surface, Cook-Torrance offers a more realistic and precise way.
