title: Basic Knowledge of Radiometry
---

In order to completely understand BRDF Theorem, we need to get the basic knowledge of radiometry.

### Radiometry

  Computer Graphic for realistic objects is based on the physical rendering model, while rediometry is the subject that measures the transfer of energy of electromagnetic radiation.

## Physical quantity in Radiometry

# Energy

   Symbol: Q
   
   Unit: J
  
  Energy for photon, related with frequency. The higher the frequency, the higher the energy.

# Flux

   Symbol: Φ (specifically in radiometry, which is different from the usual symbol P)
   
   Unit  J/s
   
   Definition: Φ = dQ/dt
   
It is infact the power, however, it is called Flux in Radiometry. It measures the total energy goes through a surface or area per unit time.

# Irradiance

   Symbol: E
   
   Unit = W/m^2
   
It is the strength of the radiance of the incident object, which measures the area density of Flux 

# Radiance

  Symbol: L

# Received Energy

   E = Φ /(4pir^2)
