title: Basic Knowledge of Radiometry
---

In order to completely understand BRDF Theorem, we need to get the basic knowledge of radiometry.

### Radiometry

  Computer Graphic for realistic objects is based on the physical rendering model, while rediometry is the subject that measures the transfer of energy of electromagnetic radiation.
  
## Physical quantity in Radiometry

# Energy

   Symbol: Q
   
   Unit: J
  
  Energy for photon, related with frequency. The higher the frequency, the higher the energy.

# Flux

   Symbol: Φ (specifically in radiometry, which is different from the usual symbol P)
   
   Unit  J/s
   
   Definition: Φ = dQ/dt
   
It is infact the power, however, it is called Flux in Radiometry. It measures the total energy goes through a surface or area per unit time.

# Irradiance

   Symbol: E
   
   Unit = W/m^2
   
It is the strength of the radiance of the incident object, which measures the area density of Flux 

# Radiance

  Symbol: L
  
Radiance is the flux density per unit area per unit solid angle.

# Received Energy

   E = Φ /(4pir^2)

## BRDF Model

the BRDF model measures the ratio of the irritance of the incident beam and the reflectance of the reflected beam. it described how much energy of specific wavelength of light is transferred to a specific given direction in the reflective surface.
